# Enumerates a poker hand.
#
# The enumeration is used to compare hands and order them by value. The better hand has a higher enumeration value. The
# enumeration is based on the rank of the hand and the ranks of the individual cards in the hand. The enumeration is
# unique to each set of hands with the same value, but is not sequential.
#
# The enumeration is computed as follows:
#   1. First, the hand is ordered by the cards that make the hand followed by the remainder. Each part is sorted
#      separately by descending rank. Jokers are given the rank of the card that they represent.
#   2. A base value is computed as the hand rank times 16^5.
#   3. The value of the individual cards in the hand is computed as the sum of the ranks of the cards times 16^i,
#      where i is 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. For hands with fewer than 5 cards, the missing cards are given a rank of 0.
#   4. The value of the hand is the sum of the base value and the value of the individual cards.
#
# The highest possible value for a five-card hand is 11464430, which is five aces with the cards Joker, A, A, A, A.
# The lowest possible value for a five-card hand is 480306, which is a high card with the cards 7, 5, 4, 3, and 2.
# The highest possible value for a two-card hand is 2023424, which is a A A.
# The lowest possible value for a two-card hand is 204800, which is a 3 2.
